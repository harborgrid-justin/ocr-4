Introduction
This repository contains the source code for an OCR SaaS application that allows users to upload PDF files, run OCR and preprocessing on them, save the files and extracted text to disk, and provides an admin user interface. The application is built using Node.js and MongoDB.

Progress So Far
Defined the application's architecture and directory structure.
Developed core functionalities including PDF upload, OCR processing, user authentication, and admin functionalities.
Conducted a comprehensive code review and optimization with a team of 12 engineers.
Addressed potential security vulnerabilities and implemented best practices.
Prepared the application for future scalability and expansion.
Directory Structure
/src: Contains the main application source code.
/controllers: Logic associated with each route.
/middleware: Functions that process requests before reaching the route handlers.
/models: Data models and database interactions.
/public: Static assets and client-side scripts.
/routes: Route definitions.
/views: EJS templates for rendering views.
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project root and run npm install to install dependencies.
Set up environment variables in a .env file in the project root. Required variables include the MongoDB URI.
Start the application with npm start.
Usage
Users can register, log in, and upload PDF files through the web interface.
Admins have a separate interface to manage users and uploaded files.
Uploaded PDFs undergo OCR processing, and the extracted text is saved for potential ingestion into systems like Elasticsearch.
Future Development
Implement advanced OCR features and preprocessing techniques.
Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
Integrate with third-party services for additional functionalities.
Expand the admin interface for more granular control and analytics.
Recommendations
Ensure regular backups of the database and essential files.
Continuously monitor the application's performance and security.
Regularly update dependencies to address potential vulnerabilities.
Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
